            <p>Hi, I’m Matthew Deutsch, a Ph.D. candidate in <a href="https://www.kent.edu/amlci">Materials Science at Kent State University</a> in Kent Ohio. My research focuses on statistical physics and understanding the behavior of liquid crystals and soft matter using high performance computing. Using computational simulations, I am interested in how these materials behave and interact at a microscopic level, including how defects form and interact in liquid crystals, helping to unravel the fundamental physics behind their unique properties.Throughout my academic journey, I’ve been driven by a deep curiosity about the physics of materials and how we can harness their properties for new technologies. Through this website, I hope to share my research, publications, and interests with a broader audience.
            <br></br>
            I develop Monte Carlo, molecular dynamics, and finite element simulations, often utilizing high-performance computing resources. One of my key projects has been investigating how chirality—a property that distinguishes left- and right-handed molecules—can spontaneously emerge and evolve in liquid crystals. I am also interested in studying active matter systems to understand how they interact and self-organize in complex environments. Previous research focused on topological defects in liquid crystals and connecting liquid crystal theories to the defect generation theories in crystalline solids. Before my Ph.D., I conducted research on the degradation and efficiency of organic semiconductors, aiming to improve materials for next-generation solar cells and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). I also explored hydrophobic surfaces using surface plasmon resonance and scanning electron microscopy as part of my undergraduate work. 
            <br></br>
            Outside of research, I enjoy hiking, camping, and astrophotography.
